# Iron Goals

## These are my goals after graduating from The Iron Yard

A few months before committing to joining the Iron Yard team, I was spending limited time every week to completing online tutorials. There were days when I finished and felt super accomplished and other days I found myself wondering if I had learned anything at all. I continued to go back over the material I had already completed, just to try and get it to sink in. I'm using The Iron Yard to get me past that point and to give me a boost into a new career that I can excel in.

What I want to accomplish for myself after graduation, is to get a position with a company as an iOS developer, at whatever level, and provide what my knowledge in a team setting. In that setting, I expect to build my knowledge to work on existing apps as well as develop new ones for clients. Personally, I will develop and release my own apps for approval to the Apple app store to build a portfolio for future endeavors and you never know, I may end up doing a little bit of freelance work.
